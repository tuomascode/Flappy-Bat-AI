# Flappy-Bat-AI
Flappy Bat AI

A Python pygame version of the popular Flappy Bird game, but with a twist - an AI controls the acceleration of the bat, instead of 'jumping'. This provides a challenge for the AI, which uses a neural network with the ability to evolve new hidden nodes and connections to learn how to play the game.

Dependencies

    Pygame

Running the program

Download files, install pygame and run the game.py file. Note that the program does not visualize the progress before a minimum viable candidate has been found, in order to save CPU time. You can control the tick rate with the x and c keys.

About the project

This project was created as a way for me to learn how to build a neural network from scratch and from first principles. The AI uses a table to represent the network and is able to evolve new hidden nodes and connections as it plays the game.

The goal of the game is to navigate the bat through the obstacles and reach the highest score possible. The AI will learn and improve as it plays the game.
